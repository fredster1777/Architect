# Architect
Coding Challenge for Architect

Use the following steps to install the necessary software.

1. Install python 2.7 (32 Bit)
    https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.16/python-2.7.16.msi

2. Install the packages inside packagesToInstall.txt
    pip install -r .\packagesToInstall.txt

3. Download and install Web Drivers (I used this version, but other browsers and versions are implicitly supported)
    Chrome (Version 74): https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=74.0.3729.6/

    Others (Should work in theory, but untested)
    Chrome:	        https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads
    Edge:	        https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/
    Firefox:	    https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases
    Safari:	        https://webkit.org/blog/6900/webdriver-support-in-safari-10/


To run the code, all you need to do is run the script "SuiteRun.py" with no arguments.
    python .\SuiteRun.py
